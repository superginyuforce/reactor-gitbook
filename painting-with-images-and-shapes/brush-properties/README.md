# Brushes

![](../../.gitbook/assets/brushstroke.png)

Brushes let you use shapes, images, and other geometric primitives to paint. You can control each aspect of the brush, like angle, scale and color, using custom combinations of constants, random values, and parametric functions.

The goal of the Brush API is to give you a friendly and intuitive interface for making beautiful, complex art with a handful of elegant geometric and procedural primitives.
