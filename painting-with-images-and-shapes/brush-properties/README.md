# Brushes

Brushes allow you to paint with shapes, images, and other geometric primitives, using custom combinations of constant values, random ranges, and parametric functions to control every aspect of the brush, performing custom procedures, at each point in stroke. Brushes give you an intuitive and hopefully user-friendly way to make complex art from a set of geometric and functional primitives.
