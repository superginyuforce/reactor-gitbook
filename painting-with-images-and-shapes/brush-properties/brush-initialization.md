# Initialization

Brush parameters define the visual dynamics of a stroke. They have several core parameters that define the size and orientation of the brush tip as well as stroke density. Depending on the type of brush, there are a myriad of other parameters whose values are computed at runtime with each stroke and can be set to fixed values, random ranges, sample sets, or parametric functions. Overall, there are many more details and features, but if you can wrap your head around the basic idea of a Brush in Reactor,  you can get quite far, generating jaw-dropping art.
